# Functional
_Exercises using functional language_

##### Rules:
Important: it is forbidden the use of repetition statements, variable assignments for future use and auxiliary variables. Your code should be as functional as possible. Furthermore, the use of the if / else statement is released.

1. Make a program that takes a list of integers and prints the product of the numbers.
2. a program that, given a numerical list, print a 2-tuple, such that
  contains the greatest value from the list, as well as their relative position.
3. Make a program that receives two lists A and B and prints the union of A and B.
4. a program that receives a numerical list L and a given number p and erases all
  the p occurrences L.
5. Make a program that receives two lists A and B and prints the intersection of A and B.
6. Make a program that determines whether a given string is palindrome. The output should be
  only the words yes or no.
7. Make a program that takes a list of integers and prints the largest and smallest
  element.
8. The double factorial of a natural number n is the product of all numbers from 1 (or 2)
  to n, counted 2 by 2. For example, the double factor of 8 is 8 × 6 × 4 × 2 = 384, and
  double factorial of 7 is 7 × 5 × 3 × 1 = 105. Make a program that takes a number and
  prints its double factorial.
9. Make a program that takes a list of integers and prints only the numbers
  cousins.
10. Make a program that receives a sequence of integers and prints this
  ordered sequence.
